Task from Liulishuo

Use Jquery mobile to create the whole app.
Because the Jquery Mobile css is designed for width=320, so I over wrote the font-size, height, width in the css. 
And changed all the color according to the design.

Use listview to show data.

Create DOM elements and insert to the listview.
Will do some specific logic when creating first and last item.

Use <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=0.5" /> for mobile device.
I set the initial-scale to 0.5 because the iPhone use 2 physical pixels to display 1px in web.
